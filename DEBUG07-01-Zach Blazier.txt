// Each time a salesperson sells a car at the
// Pardeeville New and Used Auto Dealership,
// a record is created containing the salesperson�s
// name and the amount of the sale.
// Sales of new and used cars are kept in separate files,
// sorted by salesperson ID number.
// Management has requested a merged file so that
// all of a salesperson�s sales (both new and used cars)
// are displayed together. The following code is intended
// to merge the files.
